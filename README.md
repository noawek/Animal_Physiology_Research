# Animal Physiology Lab - Breathing Pace and Heart Rate Research 🐾📊
Welcome to my Animal Physiology Lab project repository! 🔬🧬 This project explores the relationship between breathing and heart rate. After designing and conducting an experiment with real participants to study how different breathing paces (e.g., fast breathing, normal breathing, slow breathing) impact heart rate, the data collected was then analyzed with MATLAB 🛠️. Using a variety of MATLAB tools and statistical methods, I analyzed the physiological data collected during the experiment to identify patterns and correlations and to uncover key insights into how breathing pace affects heart rate.
